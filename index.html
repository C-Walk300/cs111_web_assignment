      Feel I need a fresh start on the view of the world. Lets start from scratch and introduce myself. My name is Carter Walker. I am a sophomore at <strong>huntington university</strong>. I major in mathematics and also double minor in computer science and buisness. Outside of education I am also on the baseball team here at huntington university.

  <br><br> A little more about me is I am from Santa Claus indiana which is in southern Indiana 4 hours south of Huntington. I have a younger brother and two older sisters. I lived in Newburgh Indiana for most of my life till I graduated High School. I went to Castle Highschool and also played baseball there. A fun fact is in Santa Claus there is actually an entire amusment park we have called Holiday World.
