    This Web Page is going to be more abount the Baseball part of my life. Baseball has been the biggest part of my life. I have played since I was around 4 years old. To sum up the teams I've played for are the Indiana Spikes, Newburgh Razorbats, The Aces, Castle Highschool and Huntington University. I would not be where I am today without baseball in my life.
